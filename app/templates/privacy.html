        other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for
        longer than 90 days past the termination of the user's account.</p>
    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
        anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in
        backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
        processing until deletion is possible.</p>
    <p><strong>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE? </strong></p>
    <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong><em>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
        organizational and technical security measures.</em></p>
    <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security
        of any personal information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet
        itself is 100% secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of
        personal information to and from our Sites is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a
        secure environment.</p>
    <p><strong>7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</strong></p>

        represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such
        minor dependent&rsquo;s use of the Sites. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of
        age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data
        from our records. If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 18, please contact
        us at splitrocksoftwarellc@gmail.com.</p>
    <p><strong>8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></p>
    <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong><em>You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</em></p>
    <p>If you are resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal
        information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can
        find their contact details here:<a
                href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a><br/>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Account Information</strong></p>
    <p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you
        can:</p>
    <p>Contact us using the contact information provided.</p>
    <p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our
        active databases. However, some information may be retained in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot
        problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and/or comply with legal requirements.</p>
    <p><strong><u>Cookies and similar technologies:</u></strong>Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default.
        If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose
        to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Sites. To opt-out of
        interest-based advertising by advertisers on our Sites visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.
    </p>
    <p><strong><u>Opting out of email marketing:</u></strong>You can unsubscribe from our marketing email list at any
        time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send or by contacting us using the details
        provided below. You will then be removed from the marketing email list &ndash; however, we will still need to
        send you service-related emails that are necessary for the administration and use of your account. To otherwise
        opt-out, you may:</p>
    <p>Note your preferences when you register an account with the site.</p>

    <p><strong>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>
    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&ldquo;DNT&rdquo;)
        feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
        browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT
        signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
        that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this
        Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p><strong>10. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></p>
    <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong><em>Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights
        regarding access to your personal information.</em></p>
    <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the &ldquo;Shine The Light&rdquo; law, permits our users who
        are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about
        categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the
        names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding
        calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your
        request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.</p>
    <p>If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Sites, you have
        the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Sites. To request removal of such
        data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated
        with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly
        displayed on the Sites, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from
        our systems.</p>
    <p><strong>11. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS POLICY?</strong></p>
    <p><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong><em>Yes, we will update this policy as necessary to stay compliant with
        relevant laws.</em></p>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated &ldquo;Revised&rdquo;
        date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this
        privacy policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending
